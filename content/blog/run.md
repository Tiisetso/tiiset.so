Today is the 100th day of the year. It is also 100 days since I started running again for the nth time. Bumped into T&M who beckoned me out of my stagnantion to a Jan 1st Parkrun. New year, new you. I ran, it was torturous, and it provided the impetus to once again run.

I explain my protocol below. I didn't run everyday. I was at best somewhat consistent. All my runs are on Strava. Enough talking, results first.

Metric: Jan 1st state -> +100 days Result (change)
Weight: 89.6kg -> 77.98kg (loss: 11.62kg, change: -13%)
BMI: 28.6 -> 24.9 (overweight to normal)
Resting heart rate: 72bpm -> 57bpm (decrease: -20.8%)
VO2 Max: 35.7 ml/kg/min -> 43.3 ml/kg/min (gain: +21.3%)

Total kilometres run in 2024: 579km
Recent Z2: 12.1km avg HR: 157bpm avg pace: 5'51" elevation gain: 140m
First Z2 of 2024: 5.92km avg HR: 160bpm avg pace: 8'14" elevation gain: 69m

What I love about the running challenge are the constraints. What I interesting about any problem are the constraints that define it.

We start at the simple idea that to become a better (fitter/faster/further) runner one should run more. Run more whilst avoiding injury.

My protocol
Run in Z2. Run so that I can run the next day with only a night's recovery and yet run far enough that I feel the challenge. Too ltitle distance and perhaps I limit my progress. Too much distance may require proportionally more recovery which will also slow progress. Is running every day essential? No. However trying to build a habit is and I benefit from the momentum. Likewise several smaller runs are better than one very large injury attracting run. The longer the run the harder it becomes as the heart tends to work harder and harder.

I calculate my zones based on the Heart Rate Reserve (HRR) method by Karvonen. I made a spreadsheet comparing all the available methods and given my higher max HR (and my love of Finns) this made the most sense to me. I have a maximum heart rate of about 209bpm. This is fair bit higher than most formula predict for my age. I'm not sure if it is my ultimate max as it is a very unpleasant test but that's the highest I've seen at my current age whilst toying with loss of consciousness. Resting HR is determined by my Apple Watch which captures readings throughout the day when it feels I'm at rest. This is almost always higher than the resting I have in the morning upon waking up, however I've grown to like a resting HR that is taken across the day. I use the average of the last 30 days.

So now I have a max and min limit for HR. This then decides pace or instantenous effort level. Distance is decided by the desire to run more held back by ability to recover. This is checked by managing my Heart Variability (HRV) in RMSSD which I check every single morning and whilst I sleep in addition to just asking myself, how do I feel?

There is additional requirement of trying to train my body to be able to output a certain amount of daily calories. I'd like to be to do 1000 kcal of deliberate effort every day. This the target for now. It is a number I plan to increase.

What one quickly finds is that as they become fitter they can run faster for a given Zone 2. As they become quicker they run for less time for a given distance which means less calories. Thus distance is increased. HRV is checked and if within normal bounds then the addition is suitable. If rest is required then perhaps the effort increase was too high.

Following the above also allows for variation on any given day. A run whereby the HR appears to be very hard to control on the high end can be shortened and one when the low end is too easily reached either pace, distance, or both can be increased.

This is all in the name of building an aerobic base. I also follow the Pareto principle and have 80% of my running be Z2. Which means on a saturday I can push into the higher zones. For now no deliberate speed work because my aerobic effiency is low. Additionally that would mean more impact strain and I am avoiding taxing my boady in that.

Finally, I'm in the process of losing weight. From a peak of 96kg in October 2023, I'm nearly 20kg lighter now. This alone would contribute significantly to my progress. Running is easier with a lighter frame. Take your height in metres, say 1.77m, square it 1.77^2 and multiply it by 30.6. So (1.77^2)\*30.6 for example. What you have is your weight at my BMI back then.

The improvements in resting HR though are confirmation that there is general aerobic improvement even if I feel weight changes play a big role.

Any questions? Or better yet, do you have your own approach? What is it? I'd love to hear about. I may write a longer post about this. Let me know if you find it interesting. This is just a high level overview.

Further or faster
The exists a tension between going far or fast. If you opt for HIIT training then you can absolutely improve your running performance, the challenge is that you really need to push it each time. This can be conducive to injury. I've opted for further at a lower pace. Specifically to run at what is termed Zone 2. My resting HR varies, but what I look at is what my Aple
